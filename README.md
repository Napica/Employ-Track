3. Once the SSH key is cloned, open the terminal through Git Bash.
4. Find or create the folder the user wants to work in and enter the following commands the the Git terminal:
   1. git clone [copied link] (_this will allow access the repository to the local computer._)
   2. git pull (_this will pull all the lines of script from the local repository._)
   3. code . (\*This will extract the code and link the paths to VSCode for review/editing/uploading)
5. In the the terminal, please run "npm install" (as the dependencie should be there) to download the modules necessary for this project to work.  
6.  Copy and run the information in employeeDB.sql in the mySQL workbench to create a local database for your terminal to interface with.
